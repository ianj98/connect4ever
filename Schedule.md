# Tasks
- assign general areas of responsibility (done)
- propose hardware design
- itemize hardware parts list
- order hardware
- assemble hardware
- figure out a ML approach
- decide on a ML framework
- troubleshoot code
- troubleshoot some more
- communicate with the hardware/arduino
- test hardware
- get acquained with Machine Learning, decide on which approach
- research Tensor Flow and evalulate for feasibility
- research DeepLearning4j and evalulate for feasibility
- give the computer program a name

# Code structure (?)
1. Learning phase
    - Setup the state of the world/envrionment as an input
    - Setup the neural network in the framework to learn stuff
    - Run it a bunch of times and save the learned policy
2. Implementation phase
    - Computer output a move (int 1-7)
    - Hardware makes the move
    - Player makes a move
    - Hardware passes player move to computer
    - Envrionment state changes based on player move
    - Computer makes a new move

# Individual schedules
*week of...*
## 1) March 22
  - Dennis: research the deeplearning4j framework; consider learning Python
    
  - Ian
    // Research the Torch / PyTorch machine learning framework
  - Harriet
    // stuff i will do
  - Joey
    // stuff i will do
    
## 2) March 29
  - Dennis: research the choosen framework; look for code examples to determine overall structure
