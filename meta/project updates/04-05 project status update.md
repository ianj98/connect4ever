*INCLUDE AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:*  
## Updated schedule  
### responsibilities for this past week and  percentage of completion
  - Dennis:  Start coding the neural network: Find some working code examples we can go over as a group and begin to understand (%).  
  - Ian: Start coding the neural network: My responsibility is to find working machine learning project examples for the PyTorch, Tensor Flow, and Deeplearning4j frameworks. We can use these to further our knowledge of the subject and to even modify into our connect4 project (%).
  - Harriet: Start working on the classes needed for the model and environment (%).  
  - Joey: test last molding methods (100%), finish parts list (100%), find integration for java (85%), do more coding (%).
