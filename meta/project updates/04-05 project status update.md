# Project Status Update  
**Team Members:** Dennis, Harriet, Ian, Joey  
**Date:** 04-05-2018  
**Project Name:** Connect4Ever  
**Project Collaboration sites:** [GitHub](https://github.com/pseudodennis/connect4ever), [Discord](https://discord.gg/vPjCC7r)  

*INCLUDE AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:*  
## Updated schedule  
### responsibilities for this past week and  percentage of completion
  - Dennis:  Start coding the neural network: Find some working code examples we can go over as a group and begin to understand (100%).  
  - Ian: Start coding the neural network: My responsibility is to find working machine learning project examples for the PyTorch, Tensor Flow, and Deeplearning4j frameworks. We can use these to further our knowledge of the subject and to even modify into our connect4 project (80%).
  - Harriet: Start working on the classes needed for the model and environment (50%).  
  - Joey: test last molding methods (100%), finish parts list (100%), find integration for java (85%), do more coding (%).  

### responsibilities for the coming week for each person and likelihood of completion
  - Dennis: Find a relevant deeplearning4j framework I can parse with comments and explain to the group (80%);
  - Ian: Research AI Training in relation to Connnect 4. Find a player algorithm to train our neural network against and implement into code. Get Deeplearning4j framework running. Come with a deeplearning4j example that I can break down and understand. (75% chance of completion).
  - Harriet: Work on the classes needed for the model and environment.
  - Joey:  - build prototype model (100%)
           - find way to intagrat my code with java (75%)
           - write code for relay (60 %)
           - find 3D modeling program and start model parts for 3D printer (25%)


## Resources  
### What are the most helpful resources you have found in moving forward?  
  - dl4j documentation and chatroom
  - https://circuits.io
  - http://tinkercad.com/
  - Java Connect4 Game Github Repo from Deloschang 
  - Java Connect4 Machine Learning Repo from Chris Ballinger
  
### What resources / information / topics do you need?  
  - I'm looking for a good win algorithm, because I'm sure there is one I can use instead of making my own.
  - better examples with clear code
  - help with picking the right relay 



## Journal  
### Most interesting language feature explored this week  
  - the training methods in the dl4j examples
  - the dl4j examples that actually run
  -  motor torque calculations
  -  relay circuits 

### Most frustrating aspect of project this week  
  - Trying to get Github Python examples running
  - Installing tensorFlow, python, and dl4j 
  - the paperwork/documetion

## Code Review  
  - All current code â€“ well commented  
  - Current testing plan  
  - UML of design
