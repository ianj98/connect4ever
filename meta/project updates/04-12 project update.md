# Project Status Update  
**Team Members:** Dennis, Harriet, Ian, Joey  
**Date:** 04-12-2018  
**Project Name:** Connect4Ever  
**Project Collaboration sites:** [GitHub](https://github.com/pseudodennis/connect4ever), [Discord](https://discordapp.com)  

*INCLUDE AT LEAST THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:*  
## Updated schedule  
### responsibilities for this past week and  percentage of completion
  - Dennis: Find a relevant deeplearning4j framework I can parse with comments and explain to the group (100%); Ended up spending our group/class time getting the basic game code working (100%).  
  - Ian: Research AI Training in relation to Connnect 4. Find a player algorithm to train our neural network against and implement into code. Get Deeplearning4j framework running. (75%).  
  - Harriet: Work on the classes needed for the model and environment (90%).  
  - Joey: build prototype model (100%); find way to intagrat my code with java (100%); write code for relay (50%); find 3D modeling program and start model parts for 3D printer (100%). 
  
### responsibilities for the coming week for each person and likelihood of completion
  - Dennis: Implement a very stupid neural network so we have something to work from and tune. (60%).  
  - Ian: Now that we have the chaos class working, build a class for an algorithm solver (probably named algo). 90%.  
  - Harriet: Clean up the class and split it into seperate classes. 99%.  
  - Joey: start to build parts with autoCad and Rhino(100%). Look into school's 3D printers(80%). Order parts with venmo money(98%).  


## Resources  
### What are the most helpful resources you have found in moving forward?  
  - Atom editor with Teletype. 
  - [Connect4 AI example](https://github.com/ianj98/Connect-4-AI).  
  - *Deep Learning* O'Reilly book.  
  -  AutoCad pro Trial version. 
  
### What resources / information / topics do you need?  
  - Advice implementing a NN for our specific project.  
  - 3D printer or band saw (depending on size of 3D printer) 
  
## Journal  
### Most interesting language feature explored this week  
  -  How efficiently a random algorithm can win a game of Connect4
  -  INDArrays
  -  Using a Hashset to check for a win was cool.
    
### Most frustrating aspect of project this week   
  -  Infinite loops!
  -  Debugging in general
  -  using rhino
  -  3D printer vs Band Saw

## Code Review  
  - All current code – well commented  
  - Current testing plan  
  - UML of design
